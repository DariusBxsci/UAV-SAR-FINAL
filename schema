-> DATA ACQUISITION
1. Use interface to activate radar and begin scanning
2. get data from radar
3. get data from motion tracker

-> MOTION TRACKING
1. Integrate a block of pulses (10 or so)
2. Extract blobs and find their midpoints
3. Integrate another block of pulses
4. At the new blob centers, superimpose the blobs of the previous pulse block
5. Remove pixel intensities that fall out of the superimposed area
6. Repeat, integrating pulses on the modified image

*at each repetition, update a window with the modified image
